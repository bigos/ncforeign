** What I did
Following the discussion, I attempted to create a new project

#+begin_example
opam exec -- dune init proj ncforeign
#+end_example

and copied and renamed the files from the example from:
https://github.com/yallop/ocaml-ctypes/tree/master/examples/ncurses/foreign

ncurses_cmd.ml was renamed to ./bin/main.ml

ncurses.ml was renamed to ./lib/ncurses.ml

ncurses.mli was renamed to ./lib/ncurses.mli

** What I need to do
I need a self contained example that replicates the example from ocamnl-ctypes

I guess I need to edit the dune files.
